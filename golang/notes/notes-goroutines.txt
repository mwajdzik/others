The preferred way of communicating between go routines is by using channels.
Channels are typed, one-directional pipes. We send values at one end, and receive the in the other end.

If we try to receive and there is nothing in the channel, we'll get blocked.

There are two kinds of channels:

- unbuffered - when we push we will get blocked until someone receives on the other hand
- buffered - each channel has a capacity, if the capacity is full the push operation will be blocked
